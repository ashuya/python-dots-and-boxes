DOTS AND BOXES

Better to execute it in cmd like this
python3 dots-and-boxes.py

input 4 digits separated with spaces: x and y of first dot, x and y of second dot like this:
1 1 1 2
it will crush if you input string that it can't separate by spaces and convert everything to int so be carefull by now

also your first dot mast be above or on the left of second dot, might fix it later

widht and height will be from 3 to 9 to properly render everything
